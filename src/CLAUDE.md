# src — Source code root

## Project Context (inherited)
Inherits from: root CLAUDE.md

## Conventions
- Application source code lives here
- Use TypeScript strict mode — avoid `any`
- Follow App Router conventions — `"use client"` only when components need browser APIs or hooks
- Shared utilities belong in a dedicated utils/ or lib/ subdirectory
- Feature code should be co-located with its tests when possible
- Avoid circular imports between subdirectories
